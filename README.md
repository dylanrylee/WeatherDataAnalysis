# Weather Data Analysis in Python
This project provides valuable insights into historical weather patterns, specifically 2012 aiding meteorologists, researchers, and enthusiasts in understanding how the climate has changed, and the comparison of the weather patterns from then to now.

- Analyzed and Visualized the weather data from datasciencelovers.graphy.com to identify trends and patterns in weather conditions, while also conducting the calculation for the mean, standard deviation, and variation of various weather parameters such as their temperature, wind speed, and humidity levels. 
- Imported and utilized the Pandas library to clean the dataset, and filtered the data to extract and analyze specific subsets.
- Utilized Jupyter Notebook extension for organizing and documenting the analysis process.
